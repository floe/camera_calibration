Well, looks like this whole idea was based on nothing but a massive brain fart on my end ðŸ˜‘

Explanation: when I render the calibration board in various sizes and poses, I'm implicitly creating a second virtual camera with its own unknown set of parameters, and trying to do a camera calibration with the resulting images will just give me a random mashup between the two parameter sets. ðŸ¤·

Bottom line: should refresh my spotty CV background a bit before inventing stuff ðŸ«£
